## How to contribute to datathon-mlapp-starter
### Note:
Before you start coding your contribution, it may be wise to raise an issue on GitHub to discuss whether the contribution is appropriate for the project. I care a lot about having a clean API, so I am unlikely to accept a PR that significantly complicates the API (or the dependencies).

### Did you find a bug 🐛?
Please open up a Github issue using our `bug report` template. A screenshot of the code and error message is also greatly appreciated.

### Did you write a patch that fixes 🔧 the bug 🐛?
- Open up a pull request with the patch.
- Name the pull request `🌟 [fix]: [summary]` (pick your favourite emoji 🙌)
- Write a super short PR description that describes the problem and the solution. Submit for review.
- If approved, your patch will be merged into the main branch.

### Would you like to add a new feature 🚀, suggest changes to the API 💡, or make improvements/additions to the documentation 📚?
Open up a Github issue using our `feature request` template.

### Did you 🔨 implement the new feature / write the docs?
- Open up a pull request with the feature / docs content.
- Create a new branch (for each PR) based on the latest `main` branch and name it either `feat/<meaningful_name>`, `fix/<meaningful_name>`, or `docs/<meaningful_name>`
- Name the pull request `🌟 [feat/docs]: [summary]` (pick your favourite emoji 🙌)
- Write a short PR description with the following information:
    - What kind of change does this PR introduce? (feature, docs update, ..., provide screenshots if necessary)
    - Does this PR introduce a breaking change? (Do users need to make changes in their application due to this PR?)
    - Additional information
- Submit for review.
- If approved, your patch will be merged into the main branch.
